# Overview of the statistical analysis:
In this analysis, we used Tableau to visualize data for a New York Citi bike-sharing business an explore how viable it would be. In addition, the dashboards created with data, can help tell a story to investors or business owners which helps to make data driven decisions.



# Results: 

In the first visualization, we are able to see the amount of time the bikes are checked out for. Most of the time, bikes are being checked out for less than an hour

Next, this visualization tells the story of how much time a bike is checked out for by gender. By comparison, male customers checked out the bikes more than any other customer.

This next illustration shows the average starting location for the bike rides which happen mostly in Manhattan, arguably the most tourist location of NYC.

The following heat map illustrates the amount of times during the week where bike usage happens and it is broken down by hour. As we can see, most trips happen between 6am to 9am in the morning and then from 5pm to about 7pm.

This visualization compares the times that the bikes are checked out by gender. By looking at the heatmap, most checkouts at certain hours were by male riders between the hours of 6am to 9am and the same from the hours of 5pm to 7pm in comparison to female riders

This following heatmap visualization shows the number of bike trips for all genders by hour and broken down for each day of the week, it further denotes that male users use the bikes the most, especially on Thursdays.

Finally, we can see through this visualization the average duration of bike utilization by age. Notably, people in the age born in the late 60’s to early 70’s used the bikes longer.

# Summary: 

With the help of Tableau, we were able to visualize the date for potential investors and can greatly influence the direction investors or company owners are willing to take. Data driven decisions would be the best strategy. Moreover, the data points to the potential opportunity to grow the business with female riders. Focusing on catering more to women, would greatly help expand earnings.

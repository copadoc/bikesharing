# Overview of the statistical analysis:
In this analysis, we used Tableau to visualize data for a New York Citi bike-sharing business an explore how viable it would be. In addition, the dashboards created with data, can help tell a story to investors or business owners which helps to make data driven decisions.



# Results: In the first visualization, we are able to see the amount of time the bikes are checked out for. Most of the time, bikes are being checked out for less than an hour
